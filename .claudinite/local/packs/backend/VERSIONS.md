# backend — change record

Every change automatic work makes to this pack, newest first: a prose rule added or removed, a
check created, a rule corrected against a probe or deleted as irrelevant. The row is written in
the same PR as the change it describes, so this file diffs beside it.

A run that changed nothing writes no row — this is the log of what happened to the pack, never a
log of runs.

| Date | Task | Change |
|---|---|---|
| 2026-08-24 | `growth-discover-packs` | Seeded the pack: added the wrangler-`vars`-for-empirical-values rule, the backend-verification rule, and the `bindings-only-in-index` check (with its see-it-fail fixture) for the `backend/` segment. |
