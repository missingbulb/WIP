// latency), but a runner anywhere with an issues-scope token qualifies. Nothing
// enumerates executors; identity is self-declared in the claim comment.

// LETTING GO OF AN OPEN ITEM KILLS YOUR CLAIM (DESIGN §6.2, F24). An executor
// that stops owning an item without closing it — the roll, and every
// `needs-human` park — strikes its own claim by appending the episode marker to
// it. `claimWinner` already treats the last marker as the boundary, so a struck
// claim stops outranking anything and the next claimant wins on its first try.
//
// APPENDING rather than commenting is what lets the roll stay silent (§5): an
// hourly task that declines every hour adds no timeline entry. A successful
// hand-off deliberately does NOT strike — the episode is still live, owned by the
// agent session — and neither does a close, since nothing re-claims a closed item.
//
// Struck BEFORE the label swap, so the crash window degrades the safe way: an
// executor that dies between the two leaves the item `task:executing` with a
// spent claim, which the scheduler run's leash reclaim already recovers. Striking after
// would leave exactly the state this fixes — parked, re-queued by a human, and
// unclaimable forever.

// happened — the terminal-state discipline the incidents bought. The claim sits

// THE COMMENT CARRIES THE EXECUTION RECORD (DESIGN §6.5, §15.18). Actions logs
// expire, and for an agentless run — the majority — the item is the only durable
// trace there will ever be, so the record goes where the item is rather than into
// a log that ages out. The bracketed field is this item's issue number, which is
// the only join from a record back to the work it describes.
// A status of `null` writes NO record, and that is the honest answer for a park
// that is not a failure: the vocabulary's `success` means "ran to completion and
// the issue was closed" and `failed` means the run broke, so an approval park —
// a run that succeeded and left a PR for a person — is neither. Absence is a
