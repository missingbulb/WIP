// The generator's scheduler run (tasks-dispatch DESIGN §5) — the whole of the
// queue's scheduled machinery: it decides at the anchor and files an issue
// only when there is work (#1115, decision §15.28).
//
// Four jobs: INSTANTIATE — when a recurring task's anchor comes, evaluate its
// precondition through the injectable `evaluate` seam and create the work
// item only on a yes (a no is a row on the schedule board; a read the
// scheduler cannot make fails OPEN and creates the item for the executor to
// decide); READY blocked items whose dependencies have resolved and whose
// not-before has passed; ADOPT the issues somebody marked for implementation;
// and RECLAIM dead executor claims. The executor still re-evaluates at pick
// (§6.4) — the board's verdict is a watermark, never a verdict carried
// forward — plus a one-time migration retiring the roll model's sleeping
// standing items onto the board.
//
// `planSchedulerRun` is the decision core, kept injectable so it tests with fixtures; the
// CLI shell below wires the GitHub reads, the signal-collection seam, and applies the ops.

// An id is `pack/task` or a bare `task` resolved against this repo's own discovered

// layout. Every id that matches nothing comes back in `unmatched`: a force whose
// report counts only what it woke reads as coverage it did not have.
//
// An item already in flight (`task:ready`, `task:executing`, `task:agent`) is left
// alone and reported as `already`, never re-woken — an episode boundary dropped on
// a live claim is exactly the livelock F18 describes.
//
// WHEN THE STANDING ITEM DOES NOT EXIST, forcing MINTS it (§8's other lever). A
// task that completes closes its item, and the next one appears only at the next
// anchor — so between the two there is nothing to wake, and that gap is the common
// case rather than an edge: a daily task is missing its item for most of the day.
// A force that reported "nothing to wake" there would fail on most members most of
// the time, which is precisely what a fleet-wide converge lever must not do. The
