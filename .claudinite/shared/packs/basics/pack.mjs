// The baseline pack: cross-project working discipline, the task lifecycle, and

// backfills it into existing consumers; never fingerprinted (the declaration is
// authoritative — dropping it is a deliberate choice).

  // 2 — the mechanism rename (migrations/2026-08-13-mechanism-versioned). The FIRST
  // bump this pack has taken, and the invariant it establishes: a record's declared
  // `version` must be ≤ this number, and this number must MOVE for that record to
  // reach a member already at the previous one. `migrationApplies` is `want > have`
  // against the stamped version, and what gets stamped is this manifest's number — so
  // a record declaring a version above it would re-apply every cycle, forever,
  // draining never.
  // 12: the `do-later` skill — deferring a change into work that comes back on its own.
  // 60820.1: versions become date-anchored (#1100) — the counter this list is written
  // in retires here, and every pack in the canon restarts from the same day.
  // 60820.2: a migration's cleanup is filed as work that returns, never written as a
  // later phase (writing-migration-plans).
  // 60820.3: the comment classification stays a rule and stops being a check (#1114).
  // 60820.4: verify-in-production files only after the PR merges — a rejected PR closes
  // like a merged one, so filing early strands the verification in a silent retry loop (#1128).
  // 60820.5: writing-migration-plans states the two-deliverables contract — the plan
  // is the tracking issue, never a document in the repo; the design doc carries end
  // state, rationale and alternatives only.
