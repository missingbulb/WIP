// claudinite-growth task: adopt-requested-packs — adopt the packs this repo's
// `add-packs` work-list issues ask for, in THIS repo, by this repo's own agent.
//
// THE MEMBER HALF OF THE FLEET FAN-OUT (#749). A fleet enforcer (the claudinite-fleet-sheepdog
// pack's fleet-add-missing-packs task) decides a member is missing packs — a weekly
// fingerprint scan SUSPECTS them, or the owner REQUESTS them by hand with config and
// interview answers decided — and, per member, converges one `add-packs` work-list
// issue HERE and dispatches THIS repo's scheduler with `wake: adopt-requested-packs`.
// This task is what that firing runs: code-work counts the repo's own open work-list
// issues and requests the agent iff any exist; the agent adopts with the repo
// checked out, under this repo's own executor and grant, and lands one reviewed PR
// here. The enforcer dispatches, the member executes — no agent anywhere needs
// cross-repo access, which is the failure the first design hit in production.
//
// `frequency: 'manual'` — never due on any cadence. The work only exists when the
// fleet places it, and the fleet fires this scheduler in the same breath; a cadence
// would only re-ask a question whose answer arrives by push. (A member whose forced
// run died is re-fired by the fleet's next weekly visit — the retry loop lives
// there, not in a local schedule.) A repo outside any fleet simply never runs this.
//
// WHY sonnet: the deciding is mostly done. A REQUESTED issue carries the exact
// declaration entries to write; a SUSPECTED one needs the bounded judgment "is this
// fingerprint's suspicion right for this repo", made against a checkout, with the
// pack's own README stating its boundary — and the outcome is ceilinged at
// `open-pr`, so it always lands in front of a reviewer.
//
// Self-contained (imports nothing): the whole contract is this default export.
